RETRO BOWL SCRIPTS TO MAX OUT YOUR GAME
if you are using these scripts i reccomend using retrobowlgame.io but others will work in dev tools (ctrl+shift+i) or inspect element, find the console tab and you should see a little dropdown menu that is labled (top) click it and scroll down until you find index.html MAKE SURE THE GAME IS HIGHLIGHTED WHEN YOU HOVER OVER index.html OR IT COULD BE THE WRONG ONE then simply paste the code in the console and refresh.
